### "Helping you get a RESTful sleep"  
_It ain't easy - being cheesy_

## What is it really?

Sleepy is a RESTful experimental framework, the uniqueness comes in the form of annotations.
Relying on a specified format within the method doc comments sleepy is able to parse, locate,
and instantiate a wide range of annotations.  Annotations themselves are plugins allowing third-party
developers the ability to implement new and exciting functionality whenever!
